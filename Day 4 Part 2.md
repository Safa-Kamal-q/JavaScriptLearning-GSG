 # course: [JavaScript: From First Steps to Professional](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-first-steps/)

# üîé Topics:
**1. Events & Handlers**

**2. Conditions**

**3. Loops**

**4. Map, Filter & Spread**

**5. Asynchronous function**

## ‚ú®Ô∏è First: Events & Handlers
**By using Events we make our interactive**
### üìù Notes:
* We can detect events in JS by using .addEventListner(‚ÄúeventName‚Äù, ()=>{StatementThatHandleEvent}), this method take the action's name and a handle function that JS call it when the event is fired.
* Everytime JS calls your handler function it is going to pass an event object
   * **target** is from the event object and it tells which element the event fired on
* There is a lot of event that we can handle like(click, dblclick, mouseover ‚Ä¶..)

### Code Examples
```
let trueB= optionButtons[0]
trueB.addEventListener('click', ()=>{trueB.textContent=trueB.textContent.toUpperCase()})

let h1 = document.getElementsByTagName("h1")
h1 = h1[0]
h1.addEventListener("mouseover", ()=>{h1.textContent="Quiz page"})
```
## ‚ú®Ô∏è Second: Conditions
### üìù Notes:
* If I put in the condition 0, empty string, undefined & null it is treat as false but empty array treat like true
* **! notation:** If I want the condition to be the opposite of specific value
* **&& notation** If I want two condition be true to run the code
* **|| notation:** If I wwant to run the code even there is only one true condition
* conditional ternary operator: JS also has a shortcut operator for writing quick condition, it need 3 value to work
   * code example:
     ```
     let stringValue = 4<5? "4 smaller than 5": "4 greater than 5"
     ```
## ‚ú®Ô∏è Third: Loops
**loop let us run the same code multiple time (iteration)**
### for loop
* We need to declare and initialize variable, and make condition, and change the variable(decrement, increament....)
* ex: ``` for (let t=0; i<arr.length; i++){....} ```
* for ‚Ä¶. of loops let us more easily iterate over items in a collection
* We can use for‚Ä¶of with string/ array and every iterative value
* ex: ``` for (let item of arr){....} ``` 

### while loop
When I want to run a code as long as a condition true

ex: ``` while (arr.length> 10){...} ```

## ‚ú®Ô∏è Forth: Map, Filter & Spread
**These method let us process all item in an array**

### Filter:
* Filter out the ingredient I don‚Äôt want from that array
* Filter call true false function on each item and create a new array with only the item where the function return true
  
### Map: 
* Map applies some kind of operation to everything in that array
  
### spread:
* Spread let us spread the array item one by one

### Code Example 
```
let number =[1,2,3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

let filterArr=number.filter (item => item>5); //[6, 7, 8, 9]

let mapArr= number.map(item => item*2); //[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

let spreadArr=[0, ...number, 10] //¬†[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```


## ‚ú®Ô∏è Fifth: Asynchronous function
### üìù Notes:
* JS in general is synchronous function, excute line by line
* But when we have a code that will have a lot of time to excute I can make the code asynchronous(does not wait a lot for an asynchronous code and excute the code bellow it that does not effect in the result of asynchronous code)
